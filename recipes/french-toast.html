   <h3>Desciption</h3>
   <p>French toast is traditionally made with <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-use-stale-bread/">day-old slices</a> 
    because they absorb the eggy mixture better than fresh ones (and this method prevents waste â€“ it's a win-win).</p>
   <p>Of course, a slightly stale loaf is certainly not a requirement. If you only have fresh bread on hand, that'll work just fine</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <p>Every home cook has their own twist on basic French toast, but most variations contain the following ingredients:</p>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>White Bread:</strong> When it comes to French toast, eggs are essential. The <em>proteins</em> solidify once they're heated, which binds the batter together and ensures a rich texture. 
        The <em>fat</em>, meanwhile, adds extra creaminess.</li>
      <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
      <li><strong>Milk:</strong> You can technically use any liquid to make French toast, though milk is most popular.</li>
      <li><strong>Vanilla and cinnamon:</strong> The best French toast is warm, cozy, aromatic, and sweet. The cinnamon and vanilla in this recipe are optional, 
        but we definitely recommend using them for the most delicious experience. You could even add a little nutmeg or sugar if you feel like it.</li>
      <li><strong>Salt:</strong> Don't skip the salt! Just a pinch won't affect the flavor. Salt helps break down the eggs, incorporate them into the batter, 
        and prevents egg chunks in the finished product.</li>
      <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Like so many of the most decadent foods, the best French toast is made with butter. If your French toast has the tendency to burn, try frying 
        the batter-soaked bread in a combination of butter and oil.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make french toast:</p>
   <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>Whisk milk, eggs, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt together in a shallow bowl.</li>
      <li>Lightly butter a griddle or skillet and heat over medium-high heat. Dunk bread in the egg mixture, soaking both sides.</li>
      <li>Transfer to the hot skillet and cook until golden, 3 to 4 minutes per side.</li>
      <li>Serve hot.</li>
   </ol>
